A Task Management System built with React.js and Redux enables role-based access for admins and employees, ensuring efficient task handling. Admins can assign tasks, track progress, and view status updates, while employees can update task completion and provide feedback. The system uses Axios for API integration and the React Charts Library for visualizing task progress, offering an intuitive and interactive experience.
